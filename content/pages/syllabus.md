Course Meeting Times
--------------------

Lectures: 2 sessions / week, 1.5 hours / session

Description
-----------

This is a graduate course on the design and analysis of algorithms, covering several advanced topics not studied in typical introductory courses on algorithms.

Prerequisites
-------------

Prerequisites include "Introduction to algorithms" (at the level of 18.410J / 6.046J), linear algebra (at the level of 18.06 or 18.700), and mathematical maturity (since we'll be doing a lot of correctness proofs). The course is especially designed for doctoral students interested in theoretical computer science.

Requirements
------------

There will be biweekly problem sets and students will also be expected to take turns to scribe lecture notes. It is thanks to the scribes that we can have a good set of lecture notes with many details.

Textbook
--------

There is no textbook required for the course. [Lecture notes]({{< baseurl >}}/pages/lecture-notes) are available for the current term as well as selected lecture notes from a [previous term]({{< baseurl >}}/pages/study-materials). Reference textbooks for each topic are listed in the [readings]({{< baseurl >}}/pages/readings) section.

Course Outline
--------------

Topics we will be covering this year include:

*   Network flows (max flow and min-cost flow/circulation)
*   Data structures (fibonacci heaps, splay trees, dynamic trees)
*   Linear programming (structural results, algorithms)
*   Dealing with intractability: approximation algorithms (techniques for design and analysis)
*   Dealing with large data sets (compression, streaming algorithms, compressed sensing)
*   Computational geometry
